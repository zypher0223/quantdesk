# Academic Baseline Factors — Attributions and Stance

This subdirectory contains price-based proxies for the canonical academic
factor portfolios used as long-short benchmarks in the empirical
asset-pricing literature, plus one house factor sourced from this
repository's own skill library (see the last attribution entry). None of
the original papers' prose is reproduced here.

  — Q-factor model (referenced for completeness; not implemented
  separately because the investment and profitability legs overlap
  with RMW / CMA in our OHLCV-only setting).

  *Journal of Financial Economics*, 111(1), 1-25. — BAB (low-beta
  premium; leverage-constrained investors bid up high-beta assets,
  depressing their risk-adjusted return relative to low-beta assets).
- corr_rewire (correlation-rewiring stability score) — not sourced from
  an academic paper: its methodology is the causal rolling rendition of
  Mode 4 ("Correlation-Rewiring Leaderboard") of this repository's own
  `correlation-regime` skill (`agent/src/skills/correlation-regime/`).

  machinery: https://github.com/tarvyn-analytics/corrcalc-graphs-pipeline
  (Apache-2.0; no code from that repository is reproduced here — the
  factor is an original pandas/numpy implementation).

## Disclosure: these are price-based proxies, not the original factors

The implementations in this directory use only OHLCV panel inputs.
The original factor portfolios use fundamental data (book equity,
operating profitability, asset growth) that we do not carry in the
panel. We therefore replace each fundamental input with a price- or
volume-derived proxy:

- MKT-RF: 21-day per-stock total return (vs. value-weighted excess
  market return in the original).
- SMB: negative log of 60-day average dollar volume (vs. market
  capitalization in the original).
- HML: negative 252-day return (vs. book-to-market sort in the
  original).
- RMW: negative 60-day return volatility (vs. operating profitability
  sort in the original).
- CMA: negative 60-day change in log average volume (vs. asset-growth
  sort in the original).
- Carhart UMD: 12-month minus 1-month return (matches the original
  construction; cross-sectional z-score added for ranking).
- BAB: rolling 252-day Cov(stock, equal-weighted market)/Var(market),
  cross-sectional z-scored negative (vs. value-weighted market + separate
  1y-vol/5y-correlation windows + explicit leverage in the original).

Each module's `notes` field repeats this disclosure inline. Users
backtesting these factors as research-grade replacements for the
published series should obtain the authoritative monthly return series
from Kenneth French's data library:

We link to that resource and do not copy any of its data files.

## Stance on factor definitions

Factor definitions are mathematical / academic concepts and are not
copyrightable. We re-state each factor as a cross-sectional ranking
signal in our own words and our own code. None of the original papers'
prose, tables, or figures is reproduced. The Kenneth French data
library's return series are owned by their authors and remain
externally hosted.
