"""Correlation-rewiring score: how much an asset's correlation row changed.

Reference:
    The ``correlation-regime`` skill in this repository
    (``agent/src/skills/correlation-regime/SKILL.md``), Mode 4
    ("Correlation-Rewiring Leaderboard"). Streaming JVM reference
    implementation of the surrounding regime machinery:
    https://github.com/tarvyn-analytics/corrcalc-graphs-pipeline (Apache-2.0).

The skill's Mode 4 scores each asset by the row mean of |Δρ| between an
event-window correlation matrix and a calm-baseline correlation matrix:
assets whose relationship to the rest of the market rewired the most rank
highest. That formulation compares two analyst-chosen windows; this factor
is its causal rolling rendition for daily cross-sectional use: at each bar
the "event" window is the trailing ``event_window`` bars and the "calm"
baseline is the ``calm_window`` bars immediately preceding it (both strictly
trailing — no future data, no same-bar baseline).

The factor value is the cross-sectional z-score of the NEGATIVE rewiring
score, i.e. names with a stable correlation profile rank highest. This
direction encodes a stability-premium hypothesis (rapid rewiring flags
structural/crowding risk, the classic slow-bleed shape); it is a risk lens,
not a validated return predictor — see ``notes``.

Missing data: within each window, a column must have at least
``min_coverage`` of its bars observed, else its correlations (and score)
are NaN at that bar. Observed entries are demeaned per column and missing
entries contribute zero to the cross-products (a deterministic, causal
approximation of pairwise-complete correlation).
